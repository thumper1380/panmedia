Here are some cheat sheet to help you get started:
Advertiser - the company that the affiliate is promoting products for.
Provider - the software platform that the advertiser is using to manage their affiliate program.
Lead - a potential customer that the affiliate has referred to the advertiser.
FTD/FTDs - a lead that has made a purchase.
Revenue - the amount of money that the affiliate has earned from the advertiser.
EPC - the average amount of money that the affiliate has earned per click.
CR - the percentage of leads that have made a purchase.

I have a PDF file containing API documentation for a web service. The documentation includes various endpoints, their required parameters, authentication methods, and data formats. I need to create a JSON schema integration object to interact with this API in a standardized way. The integration object should cover three main methods: PULL_CONVERSIONS_REQUEST, PULL_LEADS_REQUEST, and PUSH_LEAD_REQUEST. Each method requires specific details such as the HTTP method, URL, path, body, and headers. The JSON schema also needs to include general settings like date format and group settings for authentication.

Here's the JSON format for the integration object:

```json
{
    "DATE_FORMAT": ["List of supported date formats"],
    "GROUPS": [
        {
            "name": "Group name",
            "settings": ['List of settings']
        }
    ],
    // Structure for each request method follows
}
```
An example of a valid integration object is:

```json
{
    "DATE_FORMAT": "dd-mm-yyyy",
    "GROUPS": [
        {
            "name": "AUTH_SETTINGS",
            "settings": ['API_KEY', "URL"]
        },
        {
            "name": "AFF_SUBS",
            "settings": ['AFF_SUB', 'AFF_SUB2', 'AFF_SUB3', 'AFF_SUB4', 'AFF_SUB5', 'AFF_SUB6', 'AFF_SUB7', 'AFF_SUB8', 'AFF_SUB9', 'AFF_SUB10']
        }
    ],
    "PULL_CONVERSIONS_REQUEST":  {
        "method": "GET",
        "url": "{{URL}}",
        "path": "/api/v1/conversions",
        "body": {
            "token": "{{API_KEY}}",
        },
        "headers": [{
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },]
    },
    "PULL_LEADS_REQUEST":  {
        "method": "GET",
        "url": "{{URL}}",
        "path": "/api/v1/leads",
        "body": {
            "token": "{{API_KEY}}",
        },
        "headers": [{
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }]
    },
    "PUSH_LEAD_REQUEST":  {
        "method": "POST",
        "url": "{{URL}}",
        "path": "/api/v1/leads",
        "body": {
            "token": "{{API_KEY}}",
            "ip": "{{ip_address}}",
        },
        "headers": [{
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }]
    },
}

```
In addition to the standard fields, you have these lead variables available for use without additional declaration: {{ip_address}}, {{source}}, {{aff_sub1}}, {{aff_sub2}}, {{aff_sub3}}, {{aff_sub4}}, {{aff_sub5}}, {{first_name}}, {{last_name}}, {{email}}, {{phone}}, {{funnel_id}}.

Mandatory fields are required; avoid including optional fields unless explicitly stated. Use placeholders for dynamic settings (e.g., {{API_KEY}}, {{URL}}). Consult me for any unclear or optional fields in the documentation.

Your task is to read the PDF documentation and create a JSON schema integration object based on the information provided. Please focus on the three specified methods and include all necessary and relevant information. If any clarification is needed regarding the API documentation or the structure of the JSON schema, feel free to ask.

Return only the JSON object without additional explanations or words.
